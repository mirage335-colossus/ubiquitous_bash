A portable installation of 'Cygwin' and associated software packages may be provided under subdirectories of this directory, or archive files, especially 'cygwin' , 'conemu' , 'package_ubcp-cygwinOnly.tar.gz' . These software packages should retain all their upstream copyright notices, with corresponding availablility of source code. Many , if not most of these software packages, are under GNU GPL copyright license. Additional copies of such licenses are included in this directory for reference.

Symbolic links produced by such packages may be modified or replaced by the '_mitigate-ubcp' function of 'ubiquitous bash' . However, this procedure should not be expected to have modified the binaries themselves, which will still have been compiled from original, upstream, not modified, source code.

Such a portable installation of 'Cygwin' should be regarded as similar to the 'ISO' images of typical Linux distributions (eg. Debian), with correspondingly typical access to all source code.

A list of installed software packages and versions may be retrieved by the 'cygcheck -c' and/or 'cygcheck -s' commands .

Unmodified upstream source code is kept in source directory "_upstream" . This should only be updated in sync with the modified scripts actually used by 'ubcp' .

Some files have been modified as required or to correct issues.

Minor modifications of the 'cygwin' directory are kept under 'overlay' subdirectory . These may be under an upstream license or public domain. Such licensing terms will usually be noted in relevant files under 'overlay' subdirectory .
