Cygwin, if privileged, may create 'native' MSW symlinks by default. Package compression/decompression software for MSW may not commonly support this (although packages created within Cygwin such as 'cygwinOnly' packages *do*), effectively adding another cause of subtle, severe, deficiencies.

To possibly create more reliable packages of portable Cygwin/MSW filesystems, *always* change all occurrences of
'set CYGWIN=nodosfilewarning' or similar
to (or similar)
set "CYGWIN=winsymlinks:lnk nodosfilewarning"
.

Also interesting may be 'winsymlinks:sys' .
