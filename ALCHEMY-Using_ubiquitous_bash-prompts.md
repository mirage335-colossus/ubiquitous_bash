# Preface

Please write a brief preface text. Emphasize the use of 'ubiquitous_bash' both inside and outside of distributions/OperatingSystems . Inside - AI usage and development assistance, bash shell Quality of Life, portable (MSWindows compatible) scripting, portable software containment (_abstractfs , _fakeHome , Python 'virtualization'). Outside - build distributions/OperatingSystems with robust ChRoot, etc, run distributions/OperatingSystems as application virtualization with translated file parameters - backends _userVBox, _userQemu, _userChRoot, _userDocker, etc. Beyond that - reference implementation 'Queue' ad-hoc Inter-Process-Communication, 'MetaEngine' multiple-input-multiple-output piping.
