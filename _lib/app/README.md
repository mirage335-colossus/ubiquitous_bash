# emacs

Mostly (if not entirely) exists as a usable configuration for bash debug functionality.


# atom

Essentially deprecated by 'panelVM' functionality, which is far more powerful (having basically the same layout but using actual UNIX GUI applications like Okular, LibreOffice, FireFox, etc, shell scripts, etc).

Mostly kept as a possible reference in case atom text editor may prove useful for Arduino/SAMD debug (though atom was not at all found reliable when thoroughly tested for such use cases) .
