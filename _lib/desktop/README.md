Author 'mirage335' is aware of the position apparently taken by 'Red Hat' on 'KDE Plasma' .

As of 2021-04-25, this position is not compelling, at least not as long as Python widgets are not used. 'KDE Plasma' on 'Debian Stable' has demonstrated many years of reliability and adequate functionality from a few specific 'widgets' and 'applications' .

Such reliability and functionality is adequate to be used in 'PanelVM' and similar with typical redundancy as appropriate. Anything less should not be using GUI 'applications' at all, and perhaps not even an 'operating system' either (ie. framebuffer graphics drawn by SDL, microcontroller, etc).
