# Kate

## kate-files

Allows multiple text files (including shell script files) to be selected and opened simultaneously in a 'kate' window independent of any other 'kate' 'projects' .

Highly effective way to get a tabbed text editor with 'Documents' and 'Projects' file browser side-panels , when the full functionality of a 'PanelVM' may be superfluous. Additionally, this may be useful *within* 'PanelVM' to achieve another layer of file browsing, especially when text search/replace across a specific set of files may be desired.


## kate-dir

Mostly a dummy function, barely providing useful functionality. Within 'kate', the (usually nonexistent) 'garbage' file can be used as a file name to paste (most of) into the 'File Browser' . Mildly inconvenient, yet effective.
