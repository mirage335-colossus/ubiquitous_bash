# CC0 Contributor Agreement v1.1.0 (2025-06-12)

---
Project: ubiquitous_bash

License: CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication

## Definitions
"Open Patent Licensing" means royalty-free and non-discriminatory terms offered under agreements or cross-licensing arrangements such as open source licenses or open standards licensing.

A "Contributor" is either an Individual Contributor or Corporate Contributor that Submits a Contribution to the Project. "Submit" means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent to the Project (including pull requests, patches, issue comments, or email) that is intended to become part of the Project codebase, documentation, or other materials.

An "Individual Contributor" is a Contributor who is a natural person acting in their own personal capacity and not on behalf of any organization.

A "Corporate Contributor" is a Contributor that is a legal entity (e.g., corporation, LLC, partnership, non-profit, government agency) and any of its Affiliates. Employees or contractors acting within the scope of their employment or engagement are deemed to Submit on behalf of the Corporate Contributor, provided they have the necessary authority.

A "Participant" means (i) every Contributor, and (ii) every person or entity that receives, uses, copies, modifies, or redistributes the Project or any Contribution under the Project's public license. In short, anyone in the Project's distribution chain is a Participant.

A "Patent" means a patent, and any continuation, divisional, continuation-in-part, or other patent that claims priority therefrom.

"Software" means instructions for programmable physical apparatus, but excludes all physical apparatus such as computer processors, computer hardware, and peripheral devices. For clarity, "Software" excludes semiconductor mask works and includes services consisting of making available the functionality of software.

"My Patents" means all Patents the **Contributor** owns or can license, at any time during the License Term.

"Contributor Patents" means the Contributor's Patents during the License Term.

"License Term" means the period during which the Project is distributed under CC0 1.0 or any successor public-domain dedication approved by the Project maintainers.

"Submission" means a Contribution that has been communicated to the Project but not yet merged. A Submission becomes a Contribution once accepted.

"Affiliate" means, with respect to any entity, another entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with that entity, where "control" means more than 50% ownership of voting securities.

"Project" means the software, documentation, and any other materials in the **ubiquitous_bash** repository.

## Contributor Certification (covers this and all future contributions)

By submitting a pull-request, patch, or other material (a "Contribution") to this project, I ("Contributor") certify that:

Original Work & Authority: The Contribution is my original work or I have secured all necessary rights to submit it. If the Contribution was created within the scope of employment (work-for-hire) or under contract, an authorized representative of the employer or rights holder has also agreed to this dedication (for example, by replying "Approved for CC0" on the pull request or co-signing below).

Public-Domain: Dedication under CC0 1.0 - I irrevocably dedicate the Contribution to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication including the fallback license in section 3 of the CC0 legal code for jurisdictions that do not recognize public-domain dedications.

Moral-Rights Waiver: To the fullest extent permitted by law, I waive and agree not to assert any moral rights (including rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure, and withdrawal) in the Contribution.

Patent Grant: To the extent I, as an Individual or Corporate Contributor, control patent claims that would be infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Contribution (alone or as part of a larger work), I as a Contributor hereby grant to every recipient a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license under the Contributor Patents that are unavoidably infringed by the Contribution or by its combination with the Project to which it was submitted, to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, or otherwise dispose of the Contribution alone or together with the Project.

If I as a Contributor bring a Claim, the patent licenses granted to me by other Contributors and all other Participants will immediately terminate as of the date I bring such Claim.

For purposes of the foregoing, a "Claim" means (a) filing any lawsuit or other legal action (including any action to enjoin import of products) asserting infringement of my Patents by Software; (b) making any written claims of infringement of any of my Patents by Software, including requests to cease and desist infringement; or (c) assisting any third party to bring any such claim. However, "Claims" do not include (x) claims of patent infringement brought by me as counter-claims or cross-claims in any third-party claim of patent infringement against me; (y) invitations or offers by me to license Patents in connection with Open Patent Licensing; or (z) claims brought by me to enforce the terms of this Agreement or any related Open Patent Licensing (including intervention in a third-party claim of patent infringement against another Participant).

Irrevocability: I understand that CC0 is one-way and cannot be withdrawn once the Contribution is accepted.

No Warranty: The Contribution is provided "as is," without warranty of any kind, express or implied.

## Miscellaneous

**Governing Law.** This Agreement is governed by the laws of Virginia, USA, excluding its conflict-of-laws provisions.

**Limitation of Liability.**  To the maximum extent permitted by law, no Contributor or Participant is liable for any direct or indirect damages arising out of the Contribution or this Agreement.

**Trademarks.**  Nothing herein grants any license to use the names, logos, or trademarks of the Project or any Contributor.

**Third-Party Content.**  Each Contributor represents that the Contribution contains no confidential or proprietary third-party material.

**Revocation Notice.**  A Contributor may prospectively revoke their patent grant by [email to legal@ubiquitous-bash.org]. Revocation is effective on receipt and does not affect prior distributions.
