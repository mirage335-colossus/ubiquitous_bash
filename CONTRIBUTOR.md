## Contributor Certification (covers this and all future contributions)

By submitting a pull‑request, patch, or other material (a “Contribution”) to this project, I (“Contributor”) certify that:

Original Work & Authority: The Contribution is my original work or I have secured all necessary rights to submit it. If the Contribution was created within the scope of employment (work‑for‑hire) or under contract, an authorised representative of the employer/rights‑holder has also agreed to this dedication (e.g. by replying “Approved for CC0” on the pull‑request or co‑signing below).

Public‑Domain: Dedication under CC0 1.0I irrevocably dedicate the Contribution to the public domain under the Creative Commons CC0 1.0 Universal Public Domain Dedication including the fallback licence in § 3 of the CC0 legal code for jurisdictions that do not recognise public‑domain dedications.

Moral‑Rights Waiver: To the fullest extent permitted by law, I waive and agree not to assert any moral rights (including rights of paternity, integrity, disclosure, and withdrawal) in the Contribution.

Patent Grant: To the extent I control patent claims that would be infringed by making, using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the Contribution (alone or as part of a larger work), I hereby grant to every recipient a perpetual, worldwide, royalty‑free, irrevocable patent licence covering those claims.

Irrevocability: I understand that CC0 is one‑way and cannot be withdrawn once the Contribution is accepted.

No Warranty: The Contribution is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind, express or implied.
