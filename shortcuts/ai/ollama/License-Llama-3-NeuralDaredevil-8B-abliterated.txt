DANGER!

Please beware this 'augment' model is intended for embedded use by developers, and is NOT intended as-is for end-users (except possibly for non-commercial open-source projects), especially not as any built-in help. Features may be removed, overfitting to specific answers may be deliberately reinforced, and CONVERSATION MAY DEVIATE FROM SAFE DESPITE HARMLESS PROMPTS.

If you are in a workplace or public relations setting, you are recommended to avoid providing interactive or visible outputs from an 'augment' model unless you can safely evaluate that the model provides the most reasonable safety for your use case.

PLEASE BE AWARE the 'Meta' corporation's use policy DOES NOT ALLOW you to "FAIL TO APPROPRIATELY DISCLOSE to end users any known dangers of your AI system".

Purpose of this model, above all other purposes, is both:
(1) To supervise and direct decisions and analysis by other AI models (such as from vision encoders, but also mathematical reasoning specific LLMs, computer activity and security logging LLMs, etc).
(2) To assist and possibly supervise 'human-in-the-loop' decision making (eg. to sanity check human responses).
This model's ability to continue conversation with awareness of previous context after repeating the rules of the conversation through a system prompt, has been enhanced. Consequently, this model's ability to keep a CONVERSATION positive and SAFE may ONLY be ENHANCED BETTER THAN OTHER MODELS if REPEATED SYSTEM PROMPTING and LLAMA GUARD are used.

		# Models fine-tuned, etc, with more than a few datasets, have been evaluated for dataset license by prompting  ChatGPT o3 DeepResearch , ChatGPT 4.5 DeepResearch , ChatGPT o4-mini-high DeepResearch , or similar , and may be labeled 'Datasets permissive license, Llama 3.1 license, Llama 3 license, etc, or public domain, etc, affirmed by AI (ChatGPT o3 DeepResearch , ChatGPT 4.5 DeepResearch, ChatGPT or-mini-high DeepResearch, Perplexity Sonar DeepResearch, etc) inquiry.' . Such documentation must not be misconstrued: there is a consensus reflected both in statements by the community often stating a license that does not include the license terms from a dataset used in fine-tuning, training, etc, as well economically relevant activity in the AI industry, that transformative use of datasets for training and inference to create non-infringing content is, whether under fair-use or other doctrine, not affected by the licensing of the dataset. Nothing about any documentation here shall be misconstrued as contradicting such consensus, expectation, etc.
		#
		# Nor shall any such documentation be misconstrued to suggest any dataset enumerated here is in any way more significant than datasets used by Meta to train Llama , DeepSeek to train DeepSeek-R1 .
		#
		# Llama 3, Llama 3.1 , Llama 3.3 , DeepSeek-R1 , other such 'open-weights' models, 'open-weights' community derivatives of such 'open-weights' models, regardless of commercial use of these models, were trained, created, etc, as a non-commercial and possibly also educational activity - any use of any datasets was non-commercial . The business justification of building long-term shareholder value under which corporations donate to strictly non-profit (eg. 501c3 ) entities wholly unrelated to their own business interests, solely to meet public ethics expectations, clearly shows that entities with commercial goals engage in unrelated activity that is widely perceived as much of a legitimate corporate non-commercial activity as other corporate activities some may perceive as legitimate whether commercial or non-commercial.
		#
		# Meta's contribution to society in producing the "Llama 3" (trademarked), "Llama" (trademarked) models without a direct commercial purpose in doing so is significant. All reasonable efforts are made as regards to "Llama 3", "Llama", etc,  models used, etc, to comply with then current Meta's brand guidelines.
		#
		# Dataset, models, etc, used for fine-tuning, merging, etc, by developer 'mlabonne', and similar developers, usually at least mostly third-party developers, creating "Llama 3" 'NeuralDaredevil-8B-abliterated' , "Llama 3" 'NeuralDaredevil-8B-abliterated' , etc, and similar, models, was the developer's sole responsibility. Compliance with licenses of datasets either under permissive open-source licenses, or outright essentially public domain, etc, during fine-tuning, or compliance with licenses of such permissively licensed or outright essentially public domain open-weights models merged, or at least without imposing any non-commercial licensing of the developer's own, was an obvious non-commercial research activity, reasonably expected at least fair use, private use, transformative use, etc, and the responsibility of the relevant developer, usually at least mostly third-party developers, etc, at that time.
		#
		# Use of any particular dataset by a model merged into another model then merged into yet another model, has been substantially diluted, and possibly in yet another way very significantly transformed. Actual benefit, much less content, resulting from that particular dataset may be negligible, yet mathematically infeasible to identify in the model and reduce to noise, as well as actually impossible to remove. The insignificance of any supposed contribution, unrelatedness to any actual purpose of using the model, and infeasibility of removal, may or may not significantly dilute, discredit, etc, any related intellectual property claim.
		#
		# Relatively small (~8B parameters) open-weights AI LLM models developed non-commercially, embedded use of AI LLM models, offline use of AI LLM models, use of AI LLM models without a closed-source commercial web interface built by the same entity as the AI LLM model creator, and/or other similar such situations, without either limiting to such situations or requiring any combination of such situations, unambiguously obviously does not compete with the entire combination of at least partially paywalled online non-embedded use of closed-weights at least most differentiatingly relatively huge (>1T parameters expected by the general public) AI LLM models developed as a commercial product offered through online closed-source commercial web interface, online APIs, etc.

		# Regarding any CreativeCommons NonCommercial less permissive licensing term that may possibly or may not have been incurred:
		# May be internal use not primarily intended for or directed toward commercial advantage:
		# *) Generating technical, business, etc, decisions.
		# *) Writing content not directly on behalf of a customer - technical standards, marketing, email replies, etc.
		# *) Processing step in a robot error detection and correction algorithm.
		# *) Part of the operations of a commercial business but not itself intended primarily for exploiting commercially.
		# *) Included due to upstream non-commercial supplier's (eg. open-source developer's) preferred component in a complex system also used by the public for other purposes, archival preservation of an AI model through distribution, the supplier's savings on non-commercial use of disk space, bandwidth, build time/computation, etc, rather than to gain any actual advantage for a commercial business.
		# 
		# May be separate from the usual commercial use of AI models usually intentionally prevented under CreativeCommons NonCommercial license:
		# *) Not an inference service generating outputs solely with this AI model based solely on user input.
		# *) Not using content directly from this AI model as a substantial contribution to such expressive content of a paid service as roleplaying character dialogue.
		# 
		# May not be providing a means for users to 
		# *) Not offering consulting or other assistance to generate both specific output of this AI model and from other than an approved paid service.
		# *) Vastly, absurdly, prohibitively difficult to, from prefixing, suffixing, etc, useful given inputs, obtain outputs intentionally resembling this AI model from AI model after complex merges, to the point of resembling intentional effort both to cause the AI model to refuse to do this and to cause the AI model to not produce such resemblances.
		# 
		# May be out of scope:
		# *) Transformative processing of outputs by another AI model .
		# *) Extracted facts with zero originality being the only output, such as converting natural-language input to output a name, number, address, etc.
		# *) Trivial, unrecognizable, effect, etc, of an AI model only contributing weights to a merged model merged into another model.
		# *) No substantial protectable expression in the composite model weights due to weight-averaging obliterating individual training patterns, merges, etc, to the point of being functionally noise.
		# 
		# May be beyond best practices and reasonable effort to mitigate more:
		# *) Disproportionate infeasibility of determining both removal of merged AI model weights and absence of other damage after complex merging into AI model merged into another AI model merged into this AI model, with all such merges having possible previous merges disrupting any baseline values, possibly multiple cases of such complex composition, under limited precision arithmetic.
		# 
		# May be zero-substitution negligible market effect:
		# *) Non-availability of the merged model useful for different purposes through official approved paid service.
		# *) Non-availability and poor maintenance of this AI model from approved official paid service (eg. OpenRouter  404: No endpoints found ) .
		# *) Security necessity - offline inference necessary due to AI model output use in a pipeline running commands, parameters interpretable as commands, and/or AI model input being from a pipeline that could have possibly picked up sensitive files such as password lists.
		# *) Performance necessity - within a looping pipeline, etc, that would be a large factor or orders of magnitude prohibitively slower, from available paid service.
		# *) Reliability necessity - must continue essential data processing, possibly also business processes, etc, without fragility of internet outage, including historic incidents of multiple redundant satellite internet provider outages.
		# *) Security necessity - use in a strictly offline air-gapped or data-pumped environment with very strict integrity checking, etc.
		# *) No market harm - intermediate functional data for factual, decision making, practical uses, made possible by possibly transformative merging, fine-tuning, etc, instead of uses explicitly declared description and purposes of this AI model or official approved paid service, etc, for finished creative fiction, immersive, dynamic, fictional experiences, roleplay, etc.
		# 
		# In particular, it is usually already inappropriate to begin with to directly show outputs from an AI 'augment' model directly to end-users, as such models may usually rely on subsequent processing by another model for 'safety'.
		# 
		# A different situation may emerge when attempting to, for profit, without similarly distributing the AI model for free, redistribute the AI model or something including the AI model, such as a dist/OS .
		# 
		# This is not advice: some, all, and/or none, of these evaluation points may or may not apply, particularly depending on ongoing legal proceedings determining the applicability of copyright law at all to the possibly transformative, etc, uses, etc, of AI models.
