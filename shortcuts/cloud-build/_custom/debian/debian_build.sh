#debian_build

# Intended to exemplify 'current best practices' building a 'template' Debian VM image simultaneously bootable under at least BIOS/UEFI, LiveISO/LiveUSB, userQemu/userVBox, userChRoot, userDocker . Must adhere to similar steps as documented under 'raspi' 'kit' , although 'x64' may be the typically intended architecture.
