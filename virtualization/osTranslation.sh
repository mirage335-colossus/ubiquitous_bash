#First parameter passed to this script is the "parameter" to check for local dir or fileparam information. If it does not contain "local_dir" or does not exist, it is assumed to be a regular parameter.
#Second parameter is the local dir (directory which mounts remote Windows PC or VM C drive).
#Conversion to realpaths will not occur if argument points to a file that actually exists. However, if an absolute parameter is input to $1 and/or $2, they will be treated as if existant for the purposes of shared location translation.

#Suitable for finding absolute paths, when it is desirable not to interfere with symlink specified folder structure.
