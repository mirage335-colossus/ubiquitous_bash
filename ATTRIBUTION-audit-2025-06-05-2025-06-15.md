tldr; Auditing 'ubiquitous_bash' codebase for only CC0_licensed public domain code is possible up to at least commit 9a3f088afc46002033d9b49a08aabafacb39a9bd 2025-06-05 , and should remain as such beyond that point .

-

Up to git commit 9a3f088afc46002033d9b49a08aabafacb39a9bd 2025-06-05 , OpenAI ChatGPT Codex WebUI , Codex CLI , Cline , etc , had not been used to automatically make changes in the 'ubiquitous_bash' codebase , pull requests from Codex had not been merged, etc.

Use of other AI to any extent beyond the same code that was already in progress or copied by the AI from already written adjacent ubiquitous_bash code, up to 9a3f088afc46002033d9b49a08aabafacb39a9bd 2025-06-05 , has been commented with '# ATTRIBUTION-AI' statements. Code that may resemble examples, has similarly been commented with the URL, etc, of such examples. Third-parties did not contribute code unless similarly limited and attributed either in comments or in git commit message history, no such third-party contributions are remembered as of 9a3f088afc46002033d9b49a08aabafacb39a9bd 2025-06-05 , and any such third-party contributions would be an absolutely negligible portion of the 'ubiquitous_bash' project.

AI models for which the developers claim some terms on the outputs, such as the 'Llama 3.1' requirement to name any model trained on the outputs with the prefix 'Llama' are not believed applicable - the limited use of such outputs as of 9a3f088afc46002033d9b49a08aabafacb39a9bd 2025-06-05 is not expected to meet any originality threshold, and in any case, such content has been attributed in '# ATTRIBUTION-AI' comments, and can thus be removed. Other such claims (ie. other than 'Llama 3.1) are not known to exist as of 9a3f088afc46002033d9b49a08aabafacb39a9bd 2025-06-05 . The most usual relevant situation, if relevant to any extent all, is outputs from either the 'Llama 3.1 Nemotron Ultra 253b v1' model , or carefully generated, used, etc, outputs from a 'Llama-augment' model .

Thus the 'ubiquitous_bash' codebase up to that commit 9a3f088afc46002033d9b49a08aabafacb39a9bd 2025-06-05 , can be audited to offer code strictly available as public domain as per the CC0_license.txt and license.txt .


Author mirage335's expectation regarding AI output ownership questions, is that the training process underlying AI models is transformative, the output of such a tool as a standard computer program or service, should be at most owned by, if anyone, the end-users giving that tool unique original inputs. Additionally, originality implies a complexity beyond a mere list of facts. Expected interpretation of possibly relevant licenses applied to possibly relevant AI models may be available from other repositories from author mirage335 .

# Audit - example semi-pseudocode summaries - 2025-06-15 .

Prompt and example semi-pseudocode from these documentation files was not written by AI , as of commit 47f3c4c5a38c7ac2b7847b29137e9ede2476c2ff .

./shortcuts/git/_doc-wget_githubRelease.md
./virtualization/python/_doc-override_msw_python.md


Underlying code segment files have not been, to the knowledge of the project maintainer, since the audit of commit 9a3f088afc46002033d9b49a08aabafacb39a9bd , added to by AI contributions .

./shortcuts/git/wget_githubRelease_internal.sh
./shortcuts/git/wget_githubRelease_tag.sh
./virtualization/python/override_msw_python.sh
./virtualization/python/override_nix_python.sh

This example documentation and code segments, potentially useful as the basis of a prompt/response pair for fine-tuning AI LLM models, should be entirely CC0_licensed public domain , as of the stated commit 47f3c4c5a38c7ac2b7847b29137e9ede2476c2ff .
