REM tskill ssh-pageant
REM remove any existing ' C:\core\infrastructure\ubcp '
REM run ' ubcp-cygwin-portable-installer.cmd ' multiple times to ensure completion
REM Installation may complain about 'awk' and such not found although these resources may nevertheless be installed correctly .

REM replace files under 'cygwin' with files under 'overlay/cygwin'

REM copy missing directories/files from 'X:\' to ' C:\core\infrastructure\lean ' and ' C:\core\infrastructure\lean\_local\ubcp ' .




REM may need to run these commands from local disk with no spaces (ie. ' C:\core\infrastructure\lean ' instead of network mount
REM will need to copy 'ubcp' dir to '_local/ubcp'
REM best done from a '_bash.bat' shell due to undesirable clearing of screen after command exit from 'cmd'

./lean.sh _mitigate-ubcp
./lean.sh _package-cygwinOnly


REM copy resulting 'ubcp' installation to ' C:\core\infrastructure\ubcp ' .

'python3 -c will be passed as one argument to /usr/bin/env, rather than two arguments. Cygwin also behaves this way.'
